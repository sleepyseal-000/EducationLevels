# Education Levels in USA and NYC

Educational Insights using US Census and Worldview Data

## Project Overview
The Educational Insights project is a data analysis project that examines education in the USA using data from two CSV files, the US Census and Worldview. The project uses Python and Jupyter Notebook to manipulate and analyze the data, and then create two geoJSON maps to visualize the results
